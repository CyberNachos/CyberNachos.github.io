Since Isaac Lab's support for fluid simulation in reinforcement learning (RL) is currently limited, we need to make some modifications to enable fluid simulation during RL training.\nTo the best of our knowledge (by 11/2024), no one has yet proposed a complete solution for conducting fluid simulation in Isaac Lab. The implementation steps are as follows: Run simulation with cpu mode using --device cpu.\nAfter extensive testing, we found that fluid motion is visible in the GUI only when Isaac Sim is running in CPU mode, regardless of whether the fabric extension is enabled.\nAdditionally, it is possible to retrieve the positions and velocities of fluid particles using Python code in this configuration.When running RL in CPU mode, some parts of the rsl_rl code may not function correctly.\nTo address this, you need to add the following line to line 114 of the on_policy_runner.py file located in rsl_rl\\rsl_rl\\runners:When running Isaac Lab in headless mode, the simulator settings differ from those in GUI mode, which prevents us from retrieving the positions of fluid particles.\nTo resolve this, modify lines 213-214 in the file IsaacLab\\source\\apps\\isaaclab.python.headless.kit as follows:The Manager-based workflow does not support fluid creation and reset, so we use the Direct workflow instead.

In Isaac Lab, when creating a scene, we typically only need to create one env, and the other envs are duplicated by Isaac Lab based on the first one.\nHowever, since Isaac Lab does not support duplicating particle objects, we need to create individual particle objects for each env. We use particleUtils.add_physx_particle_system to create the particle system and the CreateMdlMaterialPrim command to bind the physical and surface materials of the particles. It is important to note that the CreateAndBindMdlMaterialFromLibrary command is not available in headless mode, so we need to use the CreateMdlMaterialPrim command instead. Next, we configure the physical properties of the particle system. We use particleUtils.add_physx_particleset_points to create a particle set, which belongs to the particle system and contains the actual particles.\nIn an RL environment, only one particle system is needed, but a separate particle set must be created for each environment. Currently, there doesn't seem to be a direct way to retrieve the positions and velocities of particles from Isaac Lab's backend.\nAs a workaround, we use the UsdGeom Points API to obtain the particle states. This is also why it's necessary to enable UpdateToUsd and UpdateParticlesToUsd. Directly converting particle states into tensors is very slow, significantly impacting RL training efficiency. However, converting them into NumPy arrays is much faster.\nTherefore, we convert the particle positions into a NumPy array and record the minimum value along the z-axis for each group of particles, as this is the only data we need.","titles":["Enabling fluid simulation"]},"23":{"title":"Distilling GPT with PyTorch and Transformers","content":"A step-by-step tutorial demonstrating how to distill GPT models using the PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers libraries.

This paper was presented at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),\na prestigious international conference that gathers top researchers and practitioners from across the globe to discuss advances in robotics, automation, and intelligent systems.\nIROS is widely recognized as one of the most influential conferences in the field of robotics, showcasing cutting-edge research and serving as a platform for sharing groundbreaking ideas. Key Highlights of the EFOLD Framework: End-Effect Modeling: EFOLD redefines the telemanipulation process by treating the task as a Markov Game, where the human operator and robot are considered separate agents.\nThe goal is to interpret the human operator's actions in terms of end effects that the robot must recreate.Deep Reinforcement Learning: By using a learning-based approach, EFOLD enables the robotic hand to autonomously recreate the necessary interactions with objects,\nleading to precise and efficient manipulation without overburdening the human operator.Human-Offline Training & Human-Online Testing: The framework adopts an innovative strategy where the DRL policy is trained offline,\nreducing the need for human input during training, and allowing humans to focus only on the testing phase. The framework was evaluated using a virtual Shadow Robot Hand to perform dexterous manipulation tasks. Results show that EFOLD can achieve real-time control with low latency and high precision. During testing,\nEFOLD demonstrated its capability to replicate end effects efficiently, achieving a command-following latency of less than 0.11s and highly accurate tracking with an MSE of less than 0.084 rad. Research Contributions: Markov Game Model: The telemanipulation problem was formulated as a Markov Game, allowing for the integration of human and robotic agents under a unified mathematical model.End Effect Categorization: Two categories of end effect extraction methods were proposed—internal and external—to enhance the interpretability and applicability of human commands.Efficient Training Approach: The human-offline training strategy significantly saves time and reduces human effort during the training process. This work sets a new benchmark for robot-assisted manipulation in environments where precision and real-time response are critical, such as telesurgery and remote exploration.

Through facial expressions, verbal cues, gestures, and physical presence, these robots are designed to build rapport with humans. Common examples include NAO as an educational assistant, Paro the therapeutic seal for elder care, and Pepper for customer service.

Critical factors that shape trust include: Explainability: Can the robot justify its actions?Adaptability: Does it adjust to user behavior and context?Agency: Is it capable of ethical decision-making? As robots take on roles in high-stakes domains (e.g., autonomous vehicles, robotic surgery), these trust dynamics become existential questions—how much control are we willing to delegate to machines? Hence, recent design efforts emphasize transparent, auditable, and behaviorally predictable AI systems, where trust is earned not just through utility, but through legibility and accountability.","titles":["Robotic Sociology: Human-Robot Interaction and the Emergence of Machine Social Structures","I.

Even disembodied systems like Siri or Alexa are often addressed with politeness or frustration—indicating a cognitive attribution of social agency. Reeves & Nass’s Media Equation suggests that people instinctively treat interactive technologies as social beings. Goffman’s Dramaturgical Theory complements this: human-robot interaction is a kind of performance. The robot \"acts\" according to social scripts, and humans “play along.” This performative dynamic is what makes robots acceptable, even likable, in daily life.","titles":["Robotic Sociology: Human-Robot Interaction and the Emergence of Machine Social Structures","I.

We must ask: Who governs robot societies?Who is responsible when systems fail?Can robot collectives develop bias, hierarchy, or exclusionary practices?How do we design hybrid social contracts between humans and machines? Robotic sociology warns us not to underestimate these systems.
